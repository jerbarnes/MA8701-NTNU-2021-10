Negative	Well made but uninvolving , Bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .
Negative	So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the th by way of Clean and Sober , filmed on the set of Carpenter 's The Thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat .

Negative	The premise of `` Abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess .
Negative	A little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , Monsoon Wedding serves mostly to whet one 's appetite for the Bollywood films .
Negative	Unless Bob Crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression .
Positive	The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .
Negative	The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington 's fine performance in the title role .

Negative	A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .
Negative	Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .

Negative	Pretend like your SAT scores are below and you might not notice the flaws .

Negative	A fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .
Negative	An empty , purposeless exercise .
Negative	Haneke 's script -LRB- from Elfriede Jelinek 's novel -RRB- is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .

Negative	A dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets .
Negative	The feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept .
Negative	This slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly -minute running time .
Negative	The densest distillation of Roberts ' movies ever made .
Negative	Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability .

Positive	This is a children 's film in the truest sense .
Positive	It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids .
Negative	Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art .
Negative	Too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .
Negative	Cherry Orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . '
Negative	What ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits .
Negative	A dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so .
Negative	The movie is without intent .
Negative	While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs -LRB- including a knockout of a closing line -RRB- , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .
Negative	If The Full Monty was a freshman fluke , Lucky Break is -LRB- Cattaneo -RRB- sophomore slump .

Negative	You expect more from director Michael Apted -LRB- Enigma -RRB- and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan -LRB- Reversal of Fortune -RRB- than this cliche pileup .
Negative	The first mistake , I suspect , is casting Shatner as a legendary professor and Kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist ?
Negative	The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .
Negative	Replacing John Carpenter 's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld Blair Witch video-cam footage .
Negative	Of all the Halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing .

Negative	Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .
Negative	The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .

Negative	A slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .

Negative	The Master of Disguise is awful .
Negative	It 's Pauly Shore awful .
Negative	Do n't say you were n't warned .
Negative	Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... or any other John Woo flick for that matter .
Negative	` Opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down .
Positive	What -LRB- Frei -RRB- gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows .
Negative	An ugly , revolting movie .
Negative	The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .
Negative	The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .
Negative	Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale .
Negative	You ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .
Negative	It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
Negative	The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout ?
Negative	From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten
Negative	My advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .
Negative	Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .
Negative	An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .
Negative	Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .
Negative	Alas , getting there is not even half the interest .
Negative	Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet\/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going .
Negative	Hart 's War seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .
Negative	Theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues .
Negative	This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made B movie is long gone .
Negative	Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama .

Negative	The film is all over the place , really .
Negative	It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .
Negative	The action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory .
Negative	Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
Negative	When -LRB- Reno -RRB- lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at George W. Bush , Henry Kissinger , Larry King , et al. , Reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .

Negative	Burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .
Negative	While this one gets off with a good natured warning , future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
Negative	Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .
Negative	Too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks .
Negative	It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
Negative	And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
Negative	The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul .
Negative	Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
Negative	The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .
Negative	The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
Negative	It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
Negative	All mood and no movie .
Negative	Press the delete key .
Positive	Simone is not a bad film .
Negative	It just does n't have anything really interesting to say .
Negative	Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .
Negative	Wait to see it then .
Negative	There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .
Negative	Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
Negative	This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
Negative	Death to Smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke .
Negative	Over and over again .

Negative	It 's not an easy one to review .
Negative	At best this is a film for the under- crowd .
Negative	But it would be better to wait for the video .
Negative	The whole talking-animal thing is grisly .
Positive	Never Again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction .
Negative	But here 's a movie about it anyway .
Negative	The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .
Positive	Those who trek to the ` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves .
Negative	But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro .
Negative	A determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .
Positive	Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .
Negative	Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... Well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .
Negative	It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
Negative	Woody , what happened ?
Positive	Juliette Binoche 's Sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of th-century prose behind her childlike smile .

Negative	Throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : So why is this so boring ?
Negative	Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .
Negative	A rip-off twice removed , modeled after -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .
Negative	Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time .
Negative	You can practically hear George Orwell turning over .
Negative	Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .
Negative	Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling .
Negative	If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .
Negative	If nothing else , `` Rollerball '' may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by LL Cool J.
Negative	How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?

Negative	Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
Negative	Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
Negative	It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .
Negative	Rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .
Negative	Report card : Does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement .
Negative	Does n't deserve a passing grade -LRB- even on a curve -RRB- .
Negative	The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .
Positive	Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
Negative	... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .
Negative	Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
Negative	Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period .
Negative	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
Negative	-LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .
Positive	And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .
Negative	There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
Negative	No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .
Negative	It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .
Negative	Nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .

Negative	But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
Negative	-LRB- A -RRB- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .
Negative	Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '
Negative	Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
Negative	The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .
Negative	We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
Negative	Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .
Negative	It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .

Negative	Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .
Negative	Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .
Negative	With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard .
Negative	Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?
Negative	Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago .
Negative	Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .
Negative	This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard .
Negative	What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .
Negative	In other words , it 's badder than bad .
Negative	If they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn .
Negative	A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken .
Negative	A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .
Negative	Where the film falters is in its tone .
Negative	The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
Negative	Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .
Negative	Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .
Negative	Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .
Negative	A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .
Negative	It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
Positive	Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum .
Negative	Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .
Negative	Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
Negative	The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .
Negative	It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up .
Negative	Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !
Positive	It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .
Negative	While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
Negative	It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
Negative	A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
Negative	If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel -LRB- or Robert Aldrich -RRB- , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and cliché .
Negative	Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
Negative	This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .
Negative	` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
Negative	The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .
Negative	Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .
Negative	It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .
Negative	Hate it because it 's lousy .
Negative	... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .
Negative	Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .
Negative	The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .
Positive	Competently directed but terminally cute drama .
Negative	The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
Negative	Not just unlikable .
Negative	Disturbing .
Negative	Disgusting .
Negative	Without any redeeming value whatsoever .
Negative	This thing is virtually unwatchable .
Positive	Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .
Negative	Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .
Negative	The self-serious Equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows .
Positive	The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way .
Negative	The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
Negative	In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
Negative	Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .
Negative	The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .
Negative	The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
Negative	The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .
Negative	- spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .
Negative	A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .
Negative	Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around .
Negative	An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .
Positive	A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .
Negative	This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .
Negative	This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
Negative	Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest minutes of your movie-going life .
Negative	The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .
Negative	Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` \/ Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .
Negative	A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .
Negative	Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .
Negative	Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .
Negative	The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
Positive	The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .
Negative	The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
Negative	Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .
Negative	What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
Negative	No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
Positive	The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?
Negative	The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .
Negative	... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .
Negative	A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .
Negative	Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
Negative	The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
Negative	This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
Negative	overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
Negative	The Master of Disguise falls under the category of ` should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live . '
Negative	Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
Negative	Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?
Negative	More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
Negative	Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
Negative	It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .
Negative	Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
Negative	A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
Negative	The drama discloses almost nothing .
Negative	A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .
Negative	Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video\/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .
Negative	As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .
Negative	A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
Negative	Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
Positive	The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .
Negative	Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard .
Negative	-LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .
Negative	One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .
Negative	Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
Negative	Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
Negative	Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .
Negative	It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .
Negative	Chen films the resolutely downbeat Smokers Only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .
Negative	... a rather bland affair .
Negative	Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
Negative	A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even Kingsley , are made to look bad .
Negative	All the Queen 's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .
Negative	The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
Negative	Rather than real figures , Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf 's encounter with the world .
Positive	Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .
Negative	It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .
Negative	I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .
Negative	If you go , pack your knitting needles .
Negative	The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
Negative	We do n't even like their characters .
Negative	Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .
Negative	The movie does n't generate a lot of energy .
Negative	It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
Negative	This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
Negative	Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .
Negative	It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
Negative	A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
Negative	The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .
Negative	Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess .
Negative	Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
Negative	Did we really need a remake of `` Charade ? ''
Negative	Stealing Harvard ca n't even do that much .
Negative	Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
Negative	The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .
Negative	You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .
Negative	I spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
Negative	Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .
Negative	The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
Negative	Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
Positive	- style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .
Negative	A feeble Tootsie knockoff .
Negative	An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
Negative	... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
Negative	The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
Negative	An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .
Negative	One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .
Negative	A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick .
Negative	-LRB- Hell is -RRB- looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara is n't even halfway through .
Negative	Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .
Negative	Leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
Negative	Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .
Negative	The histrionic muse still eludes Madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .
Negative	You have no affinity for most of the characters .
Negative	Nothing about them is attractive .
Negative	What they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .
Positive	Diaz , Applegate , Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .
Negative	An inept , tedious spoof of 's kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
Negative	It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .
Negative	Eight Legged Freaks falls flat as a spoof .
Negative	No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a -year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .
Negative	You 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
Negative	` Dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .
Negative	Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
Negative	How about surprising us by trying something new ?
Negative	Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .
Negative	Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .
Negative	Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
Negative	You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .
Negative	A full-frontal attack on audience patience .
Negative	It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .
Negative	Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .
Negative	Too bad none of it is funny .
Negative	The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .
Negative	Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .
Positive	Oh , and more entertaining , too .
Negative	... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
Negative	Humor in I Spy is so anemic .
Negative	The film is strictly routine .
Negative	In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
Negative	You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
Negative	Barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
Negative	We get the comedy we settle for .
Negative	The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .
Negative	A word of advice to the makers of The Singles Ward : Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs .
Negative	And neither do cliches , no matter how ` inside ' they are .
Positive	The campy results make Mel Brooks ' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated .
Negative	Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .
Negative	The Hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork .
Negative	Cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film .
Negative	Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .
Negative	All three descriptions suit Evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .
Positive	Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .
Negative	True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .
Negative	Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago .
Negative	The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
Negative	Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .
Negative	Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .
Negative	It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush .
Negative	Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
Negative	... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
Negative	The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .
Negative	Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
Negative	Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
Negative	The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .
Negative	This director 's cut -- which adds minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .
Negative	Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
Negative	That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . ''
Negative	It 's a movie that ends with Truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud .
Negative	If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .
Negative	Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .
Negative	It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in .
Negative	Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
Negative	As pedestrian as they come .
Negative	A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .
Negative	It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
Negative	More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .
Negative	An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .
Negative	The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here .
Negative	As saccharine as it is disposable .
Negative	You come away thinking not only that Kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .
Negative	The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
Negative	Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
Negative	Too much power , not enough puff .
Negative	The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
Negative	It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
Negative	A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
Negative	For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull Sorvino has no light touch , and Rodan is out of his league .
Negative	Narc is all menace and atmosphere .
Negative	Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
Negative	It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
Negative	his -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
Negative	It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
Negative	A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
Negative	There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .
Negative	As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .
Negative	Enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid .
Positive	`` Sweet Home Alabama '' is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film ...
Positive	One of the best , most understated performances of -LRB- Jack Nicholson 's -RRB- career .
Positive	The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys ' take on adolescence feels painfully true .
Positive	It 's a masterpiece .
Negative	They crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness .
Positive	And we do n't avert our eyes for a moment .
Positive	Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !
Positive	By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .
Positive	Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .
Positive	` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
Positive	The film delivers what it promises : A look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .
Positive	As a film director , LaBute continues to improve .
Positive	Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it .
Positive	Catch it ... if you can !
Negative	American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone .
Positive	` Possession , ' based on the book by A.S. Byatt , demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
Positive	It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
Positive	Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience .
Positive	The script is smart , not cloying .
Positive	Visually , ` Santa Clause ' is wondrously creative .
Positive	A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
Positive	One fantastic -LRB- and educational -RRB- documentary .
Positive	An ambitious ` what if ? '
Positive	that works .
Positive	`` The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
Positive	Nice piece of work .
Positive	` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
Positive	It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true .
Positive	Though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable .
Positive	From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge '
Positive	Apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen .
Positive	Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .
Negative	Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .
Negative	Go back to sleep .
Negative	I did n't laugh .
Negative	I did n't smile .
Negative	The worst film of the year .
Negative	In the book-on-tape market , the film of `` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' would be an abridged edition
Negative	A sour attempt at making a Farrelly Brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set .
Negative	Eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema 's directorial giants .
Negative	Taken as a whole , The Tuxedo does n't add up to a whole lot .
Negative	This is no `` Waterboy ! ''
Negative	Something has been lost in the translation ... another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .
Negative	The result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis .
Negative	... a movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made .
Positive	By turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious .
Negative	I ca n't recommend it .
Positive	But it 's surprisingly harmless .
Positive	What 's next ?
Negative	The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .
Negative	Absolutely not .
Negative	It sucked .
Negative	A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .
Negative	This is n't a movie ; it 's a symptom .
Negative	What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .
Negative	If only it were , well , funnier .
Negative	The script ?
Negative	Does n't add up to much .
Negative	One of the worst movies of the year .
Negative	A complete waste of time .
Negative	Long before it 's over , you 'll be thinking of ways to leave this loser .
Negative	One of the worst movies of the year .
Negative	... Watching it was painful .
Negative	The cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .
Positive	Spiderman ROCKS
